Things we can reproduce:
- Descriptive statistics and ANOVA results for looking time data.
- Results are also robust to being re-run in Mixed-Effects-Models (except for the 12-month-olds)
- Time course plots
- Descriptive statistics and ANOVA for switch analysis


Things we cannot reproduce:
- For 12 month olds results (experiment 2) do not hold up to Mixed model analysis. 
- Cluster based analysis ??

Questions:
- Why were the videos of different length -> justify?
- Why were they paced in different speed > justify?
- How was the end of the deduction phase determined?
- Looking time experiments are all analyzed by age group, why was the switch analysis combined for both age groups (note: results mainly driven by 19mo, no sig. result for 12mo when analyzed separately)? 

Things to do:
- Cluster based (r-package)



## Experiment 1 and 2
### Looking time
Both 12- and 19-month-olds looked longer at the inconsistent outcome, suggesting that they may have derived the identity of the object in
the cup through logical inference and were surprised when this conclusion was violated, as revealed by mean looking times, M [experiment 1, 19-month-olds (n = 24), Mconsistent = 7.7 s, Minconsistent = 10.5 s, F(1,23) = 5.79, P = 0.025; experiment 2, 12-month-olds 
(n=24),Mconsistent=6.2 s, Minconsistent= 7.6s, F(1,23) = 5.19, P = 0.032; repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs)].

## Experiment 3 and 4
### Looking time
Both 19 and 12-month-olds looked longer at the inconsistent outcome (Fig. 2C), suggesting that they reacted to the logical gist of
a scene [experiment 3, 19-month-olds (n = 24), Mconsistent = 4.9 s, Minconsistent = 6.2 s, F(1,23) = 8.5,
P = 0.008; experiment 4, 12-month-olds (n = 24),Mconsistent= 4.2 s,Minconsistent = 6.1 s, F(1,23) = 11, P = 0.003; repeated measures ANOVAs].

## Experiments 5 and 6
### Looking time (paradigm validation)
As expected at these ages, infants looked longer at an outcome inconsistent with the identity of the (known) object in the cup [experiment 5, 19-month-olds (n = 24), Mconsistent = 3.8 s, Minconsistent = 8.3 s, F(1,23) = 26.1, P = 0.0001; experiment 6, 12-month-olds (n =24), Mconsistent=4.9s, Minconsistent=6.2 s, F(1,23) = 4.9, P = 0.037; repeated measures ANOVAs].

### Eye-tracking analyses
By the end of this phase, infants also displaced their eyes toward the cup more markedly (Fig. 3, B and C, and supplementary
materials) and switched their focus from the visible object to the cup inmore trials (Minference = 71%, Mno_inference = 50%, F1,88 = 10.4, P = 0.002, two-way ANOVA; fig. S2 and supplementary materials) when a deduction was needed than when it was not.
